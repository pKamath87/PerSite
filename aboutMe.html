                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm Pranav Kamath, a passionate student with a strong interest in web 
                    development and technology. I'm excited to share a little bit about myself.
                <p>

                    <h3>Web Development:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I find the process of building and shaping the online experience incredibly rewarding. Whether it's 
                        crafting responsive and user-friendly websites or diving into the intricacies of web technologies, web 
                        development has always been at the heart of my digital journey.

                    <h3>Programming:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a deep love for programming. It's the art of turning ideas into functional software, and the thrill
                        of solving complex problems through code is what drives me forward. From scripting to software development, programming 
                        is where I feel at home.

                        Aesthetics and user experience matter to me. I believe that good design goes hand in hand with effective functionality.

                        constant pursuits.
