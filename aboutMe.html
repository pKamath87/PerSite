            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm Pranav Kamath, a passionate student with a growing interest in web 
                    development and technology. I'm excited to share a little bit about myself.
                <p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>Here are some facts about me between coding and personal interests</p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        I often find that the process of creating and delivering a successful online experience can be incredibly rewarding. 
                        Whether it's crafting responsive and user-friendly websites for friends and family or experimenting with solo 
                        projects, I am committed to maximizing my effectiveness in web development.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have spent several years now refining my programming skills, focusing on the ability to transform ideas into practical 
                        software solutions and devising methods to tackle complex problems through coding. In the end I find that the reward comes
                        from overcoming difficult problems through effective algorithms that creates enjoyment.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whereas complex problems often require complex solutions, I prioritize designing towards how things look and work for users.
                        I enjoy exploring design, making things look nice, and easy to use.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
